		<h3> :: Saturday, February 27 2016 :: </h3>
		<p>Fishing has been up and down this week. We've moved houses a little deeper on the lake where it seems the fishing has picked up. Active jigging with a dead stick has been the ticket with pink and gold jigs getting the most action. We still have about 18" inches of ice in most spots on the lake, but please stay on plowed roads as it has been a strange winter this year and there are chances of thinner ice in places that aren't being traveled.</p>

		<h3> :: Saturday, February 20 2016 :: </h3>
		<p>Fishing has been a little slow this week. Being patient, persistent, and agressive is vital in getting a full bucket of fish. We've seen more eater suagers than walleyes this week. Using electronics, although not necessary, will help increase your chances. Good luck!</p>

		<h3> :: Saturday, February 13 2016 :: </h3>
		<p>Although fishing has slowed a bit since the beginning of the season, we're still seeing some decent walleyes and saugers! Anglers are having to work a little harder to snag a good day of fishing. Active jigging with smaller jigs and minows have been the ticket. Gold, orange, black, pink and glow colors are hot! Fish on!</p>
